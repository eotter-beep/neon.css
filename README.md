# neon.css

No classes, variables, just code like how you would in HTML! The exceptions are extra features added, so its a good idea to read the tags if you want to do the extras

## `bgimage`

To use `bgimage`, simply do:

```html
<bgimage class="--bg-url: url('https://yoururl.com');"></bgimage>
```
